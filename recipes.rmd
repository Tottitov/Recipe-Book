- 1/4 cup black pepper
- 1/2 cup Korean red pepper powder
- 1/4 cup chili flakes (optional)
- 1 tsp MSG (optional)
- Whisk/chopsticks
- Soup spoon
- Large mixing bowl
- Glass measuring cup

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 165°F.
2. Use a small soup spoon to crack a small hole into the pointy end of each egg and empty the contents into a large mixing bowl. Place the emptied eggshells back into their original cartons.
3. In the large mixing bowl with the egg contents, add the measured amounts of fish sauce, oil, chicken bouillon powder, sugar, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, Korean red pepper powder, chili flakes (if desired), and MSG (if desired).
4. Mix well using a whisk or chopsticks until all the ingredients are incorporated and the mixture becomes smooth.
5. Pour the mixed egg contents back into the eggshells using a glass measuring cup, filling them all the way. Place the filled eggshells back in the cartons.
6. Place the egg-filled cartons in the preheated oven and bake at 165°F for approximately 1.5-2 hours or until the egg mixture is set and does not stick to a toothpick.
7. Remove from the oven and let the baked eggs cool before serving. Enjoy!
